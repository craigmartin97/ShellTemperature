1. Better DateTime picker needed. I think its important to be able to choose time
I may need to create on. XCeed's is a pain to use and doest respond well to the up/down arrow being pressed

2. Outiers - Can I use machine learning to detect outliers? i.e. Sudden drop to 2 and then straight back up
is a clear outlier.

3. Multiple devices - ATM, it is configured for one device can I device a configurable way to add more devices

4. Date time on XAxis - Needs to be a readable datetime i think.
