1. Better DateTime picker needed. I think its important to be able to choose time
I may need to create on. XCeed's is a pain to use and doest respond well to the up/down arrow being pressed

2. Outiers - Can I use machine learning to detect outliers? i.e. Sudden drop to 2 and then straight back up
is a clear outlier.

3. Date time on XAxis - Needs to be a readable datetime i think.

4. Styling on combobox.

5. What if config file does not contain the name, i.e. what is the device address is not in there
and it outputs blank. Can I prompt the user / display message to say, "The device at address XXXXX needs 
to be added to config for specific device name"???
