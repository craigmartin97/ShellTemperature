Add filter on Shell Temperature page where users can search for tempeartures equal to or less than or equal to

Add google maps, so the GPS position can be seen on google maps

-- Add a function that allows the data to be sent to excel. I.e. you press the button and the data is sent to an excel spread sheet

Graphs on the report page, so plot the standard deviation, mean deviation on charts

When no devices are connected, change message bar at top to display that
