1. Better DateTime picker needed. I think its important to be able to choose time
I may need to create on. XCeed's is a pain to use and doest respond well to the up/down arrow being pressed

2. Outiers - Can I use machine learning to detect outliers? i.e. Sudden drop to 2 and then straight back up
is a clear outlier.

3. Date time on XAxis - Needs to be a readable datetime i think.

5. What if config file does not contain the name, i.e. what is the device address is not in there
and it outputs blank. Can I prompt the user / display message to say, "The device at address XXXXX needs 
to be added to config for specific device name"???

6. Can I make the system be able to find new sensors on a btn pressed

7. Should I have a seperate thread that checks if the device is connected and 
another reading the data in?

8. Add Btn to clear graph and temperature data

9. Allow user to remove single temperature value

10. Display DateTime next to temperature on Live Shell Data View

11. Documentation
